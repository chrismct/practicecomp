# Home Credit Default Risk

## Business Problem Statement

Many individuals with limited or no credit history struggle to obtain loans, often falling prey to unreliable lenders. Home Credit Group aims to broaden financial inclusion by providing safe loans to these individuals. This project will focus on improving Home Credit’s loan predictions of client’s repayment abilities. Effectively allowing them to reach more people without the risk of sky rocketing default rates.

## Problem Solution

For this project, our solution was centered around training a machine learning model that can assist Home Credit in identifying as many high risk customers as possible, while also minimizing the number of clients with adequate loan repayment capabilities that are missed, in support of Home Credit's mission as a company of extending financial services to historically underserved segments of the population. A multitude of a model's were tested, with numerous iterations of hyperparameters and data structures included. Utlimately, the model that produced the best results was an XGBoost model with an expaded feature space with variables not included in the original data set.  

## My Contributions

My main contributions for this project was in the data exploration and modeling phases of the project, as well as builiding our final presentation to stakeholders. Most importantly, I was tasked with building and testing the various iterations of the XGBoost model that we ultimately ending up producing the best results we can manage. 

## Value Derived from Analysis

As mentioned previously, the XGBoost model including the expanded feature space produced the best results for what we determined would provide the Home Credit business the optimal monetary value and growth potential while also holding true to their values as a company. There were a total of 4500 instances within the available dataset representing individuals who defaulted on their loans. As things currently stand in Home Credit's customer assessment process, very few of these individuals would have been identified as high risk. The average loan value of Home Credit's clients is $557,778 resulting in
